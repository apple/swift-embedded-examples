# Install Embedded Swift

Get the tools needed to use Embedded Swift.

## Overview

Embedded Swift is an experimental and rapidly developing feature of the Swift language, as such it is only available in "Development Snapshot". 

The best way to install Swift is using [`swiftly`](http://github.com/swiftlang/swiftly), the official Swift toolchain installer and manager. For instructions on how to install `swiftly`, check out the [Getting Started](https://www.swift.org/swiftly/documentation/swiftly/getting-started) guide.

> Note: Swiftly installs the latest release toolchain during `swiftly init`, if you only plan on using Embedded Swift, you can avoid downloading this toolchain by using the `swiftly init --skip-install` option. 

After installing Swiftly, install the latest main "Development Snapshot" toolchain available for your platform by running:

```shell
$ swiftly install main-snapshot
...
main-snapshot-2025-04-12 installed successfully!
```

To test that you have Swift installed, run `swift --version` from your shell or terminal app. It should say "6.2-dev", meaning you have a "Development Snapshot" toolchain.

```shell
$ swift --version
Apple Swift version 6.2-dev (LLVM 81ab6d9f7e4810f, Swift 9cc1947527bacea)
Target: arm64-apple-macosx15.0
Build config: +assertions
```

> Warning: When using other shells, like one integrated into an IDE, be careful to verify that the version of Swift reported matches that of the shell you used to install Swift.
